# Dog-Breed-identification
Dog breed Identification using Transfer Learning
Keras with Tensorflow backend is being used for building a deep learning model
120 different dog breeds are identified using Deep CNN.
3 existing transfer learning models are compared and InceptionResnetV2 model is chosen for doog breed identification
